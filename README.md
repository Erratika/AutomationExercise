# Project Goal


# Plan
## Step 1 - Initial Meeting
Following on from the handout of the project we quickly had a meeting with all member of the project and worked on identifying what our first steps should be. We came together to plan the following:
1. Initialise a GitHub repository and project kanban board for tracking issues.
2. Manually research the website we are to test for the project and identify which testable features we should be writing up.
3. Having identified which testable features the website has we would begin to write Gherkin scripts in GitHub issues for each appropriate scenario.
4. Implement the skeleton of the test framework such as web driver functionallity,reporting and web page models.
5. Transfer the written Gherkin scripts into Cucumber features inside the project.
6. Create step definitions for the Cucumber steps; binding our Cucumber features and web page models.

## Step 2 - Initialise GitHub Repository and Project
Immediately following our meeting our first course of action was to initialise a simple barebones GitHub Repository and GitHub project Kanban board for tracking issues. \
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Erratika/AutomationExercise) \
[GitHub Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Erratika/projects/3) 

## Step 3 - Identify Testable Features
We then proceeded to take a manual look around the website and identify what features that the website has that could be appropriate for testing in our framework. Here is a list of some of the functionallity we identified that could be tested:
- Sign-up
- Login
- Account Management
- Basket
- Checkout 
- Search & Categorisation
- View Product
- Review
- Contact Us
- Email Subscription

## Step 4 - Writing up Gherkin Scripts
The next step of pour process was to take the website features that we identified and to build test scenario's around them; further fleshing out what our test scenarios would look like. These were written into GitHub issues for each feature we identified and further elaborated upon with independent scenarios within.

## Step 5 - Implement Test Framework
After having fleshed out our testable features into Gherkin script we plan to start implementing the skeleton of our test framework. This will include:
- Instantiation of our web driver for use when running the tests for the project.
- Creating POM models for each webpage we would be utilising for our testing. 
- Adding reporting functionality so that it is available from the start.
